            <span class="subtitle">Every single person has a place they call home.
                 Although as the saying goes, home is not a place, its a feeling.
                  Wherever that feeling is, its got to be in a place. Many people 
                  struggle to reach their destinations largely because of the long
                   queues at different bus stations. And in this period of corona virus,
                    that is very dangerous as the SOPs are not practiced. With the bus ticket 
                    reserve system, we give you the power to book a sit and buy a ticket from
                     the comfort of your sofa at home or wherever you are. </span>
